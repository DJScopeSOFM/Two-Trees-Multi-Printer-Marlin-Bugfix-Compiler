In this file you need to chose the cofiguration that you want for the firmware.
Please pick only from the options and make sure that it is written as #defined <option> and nothing else.

  Remove the // before define to select the option. Please have only one option activated at once.

       eg.     //#define Sapphire_Bluer    << Not selected
                 #define Sapphire_Bluer    << Selected


Keep a copy of this setup file so that if future upgrades to the firmware become available, you don't need to update any of the firmware files.
But if the time comes that I need expand or modify the setup.h file, I will let you know in advance so that you can update your setup file.

<<<<<<<< PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY! >>>>>>>>

This firmware has a couple of changes from standard to make it less hassle to maintain and customise. So please bare these notes in mind!
  1) The BLTouch/3D Touch 2pin trigger cable is plugged into the PW_DET header on the main board. NOT THE Z MIN/MAX ENDSTOP! << IMPORTANT
  2) Junction Deviation is on and set to J0.13 by default. You may change this in the LCD in Setting > Configuration > Advanced > Junction Deviation
  3) Linear Advance is on but is set to K0.00 by default. Setting > Configuration > Advanced > Fillament > Linear Advance
      3a) Please note that Linear Advance is not compatible with the TMC2208 and is set to K0 on purpurse. If you change to a custom driver for the
          extruder. This will be set to K0.25 by default.
  4) Thing to do on you first run:
      4a) Do a PID Autotune. Go to Setting > Configuration > Advanced > Temperature
            Select PID Autotune E1 and choose 10C above the nominal highest temperature you are planning on printing on the hotend. Then, once finished;
            Select PID Autotune BED and choose 10C above the nominal highest temperature you will be using on the bed.
            Store the settings! (M500)
      4b) Generate a bed mesh. Go to Settings > Motion > Bed Levelling (menu name is different depending on the type chosen below)
          Best practice is the put :M420 S1" after "G28" in you start gcode if you're not planing to run G29 in your start gcode.
      4c) If you haven't calibrated your printer, please follow this link and do the step by step guide: https://teachingtechyt.github.io/calibration.html
  5) Store settings after any changes you make in the LCD menus. Setting > Configuration > Store Settings (or run M500 in terminal).

Enjoy!

       DJScope (Igor Rebenko) you can find me on the Two Trees Facebook Group if you need any queries answered.

    PS. If you run into any weird behaviour by the printer, like weird homing and such. First restart the printer.
    If still happening, initialise EEPROM, restore defaults, and store settings.
    Last resort is to reflash the firmware file.
    Usually a simple restart fixes all issues                                                                         */

  //#define bltouch_7x7                    // Bltouch ABL with a 7x7 grid. Slow. If you want this, I suggest Unified Bed Leveling below, but it's up to you.
